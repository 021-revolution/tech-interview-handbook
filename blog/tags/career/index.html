have been asking me questions related to Facebook internships, working at Facebook, and my personal journey. I decided to write down my answers in the form of a blog post so they can be shared more broadly and I can point people to this blog post in future whenever I get asked similar questions.</p><p><strong><em>I am not a recruiter and I might have answered some of the recruiting or internship-related questions wrongly, so take them with a grain of salt.

Recruiters will reach out to you if there&#x27;s interest and chat with you over the phone. If it goes well, there will be two rounds of coding interviews.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="what-are-some-qualitiesexperiences-that-facebook-looks-for-in-a-resume"></a>What are some qualities/experiences that Facebook looks for in a resume?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-some-qualitiesexperiences-that-facebook-looks-for-in-a-resume" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>IANAR and I don&#x27;t filter any resumes, so I don&#x27;t exactly know. But from experience, write stuff that makes you stand out from the rest. Have good grades? Add it in. Scholarships/awards, write them down. Have extensive internship experience? Include them in an organized format. Built cool hacks/side projects? Add the GitHub links and demos. Won hackathons/competitions? Put them in. One thing is for sure - few companies would want to hire candidates who only have academic credentials and no industry experience.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="does-gpa-affect-a-lot-on-the-resume-screening"></a>Does GPA affect a lot on the resume screening?<a class="hash-link" href="#does-gpa-affect-a-lot-on-the-resume-screening" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>GPA/CAP/grades is just one of the signals that can be extracted from the resume. As mentioned above, there are many other qualities and achievements a candidate can possess. Personally if I had my own company, I would rather hire a candidate with a high second upper and fantastic open source portfolio with multiple internship experiences at big companies over a student with CAP 5.00 but has nothing else to show for. Not that one candidate is stronger than the other, but the former would probably be a safer choice.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="in-general-hows-the-barrier-of-entry-for-big-tech-companies-like-fb-in-terms-of-grades-would-a-second-lower-35-39-even-get-pass-the-resume-screening-stage"></a>In general, how&#x27;s the barrier of entry for big tech companies like FB in terms of grades, would a second lower (3.5-3.9) even get pass the resume screening stage?<a class="hash-link" href="#in-general-hows-the-barrier-of-entry-for-big-tech-companies-like-fb-in-terms-of-grades-would-a-second-lower-35-39-even-get-pass-the-resume-screening-stage" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Grades matter less the longer someone has left school. For students, because there&#x27;s a lack of working experience, grades might play a larger part in the resume screening, but it&#x27;s by no means the only thing that matters.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="is-the-resume-screening-done-by-ai--human-recruiter-what-is-being-looked-out-for-on-the-resume-as-someone-who-isnt-strong-academically-will-i-be-able-to-compete-purely-based-on-experience-on-my-resume"></a>Is the resume screening done by AI / human recruiter? What is being looked out for on the resume? As someone who isn&#x27;t strong academically, will I be able to compete purely based on experience on my resume?<a class="hash-link" href="#is-the-resume-screening-done-by-ai--human-recruiter-what-is-being-looked-out-for-on-the-resume-as-someone-who-isnt-strong-academically-will-i-be-able-to-compete-purely-based-on-experience-on-my-resume" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>IANAR. Usually people suck at their studies because instead of studying they spent their time elsewhere. If it was spent on related stuff like hacking on side projects and internships, that probably makes up for the subpar academic grades. But if you suck at studies and spent your time clubbing instead, then I&#x27;m sorry you probably won&#x27;t get past the screening. Note that CS is such a hot course now that only the best students can get in these days. A fair amount of students have both good grades AND non-academic achievements. Competition is tough!</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="are-there-any-languagesframeworks-that-are-helpful-to-know-before-applying"></a>Are there any languages/frameworks that are helpful to know before applying?<a class="hash-link" href="#are-there-any-languagesframeworks-that-are-helpful-to-know-before-applying" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>For Software Engineering (SWE) positions, Facebook doesn&#x27;t require you to have experience in specific languages/frameworks before joining. Likewise, there aren&#x27;t any of such restrictions for SWE interviews. You can do your interviews in your programming language of choice. One exception to this is if you&#x27;re applying for a Front End Engineer or Mobile Engineer position, then you will be asked domain-specific questions and by extension, required to use JavaScript/Java/Kotlin/Objective-C/Swift to answer the questions.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="are-intern-applications-and-hence-the-spots-based-on-first-come-first-served"></a>Are intern applications (and hence, the spots) based on first-come-first-served?<a class="hash-link" href="#are-intern-applications-and-hence-the-spots-based-on-first-come-first-served" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>IANAR. But as with all jobs, there are definitely limited spots and once they&#x27;re filled up there isn&#x27;t a need to hire anymore. Applying in 2022 for the internship which application opens in September, is almost definitely too late. You can apply later (October) if you want more time to prepare, but there might be fewer slots left. Moral of the story - prepare early.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="hows-the-referral-process-aboutlike"></a>How&#x27;s the referral process about/like?<a class="hash-link" href="#hows-the-referral-process-aboutlike" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Facebook will send you a form (initiated by me) where you can fill up your name, email, upload your resume, and select the roles you would like to apply. From there on, from an applicant perspective it&#x27;s not different from them applying themselves on the Facebook Careers Portal.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="may-i-know-until-when-your-referral-is-valid-i-was-hoping-to-start-my-application-a-bit-later-so-was-hoping-to-reach-out-to-you-then-for-a-referral-is-there-any-last-date-to-claim-this-in-any-way"></a>May I know until when your referral is valid? I was hoping to start my application a bit later so was hoping to reach out to you then for a referral. Is there any last date to &quot;claim&quot; this in any way?<a class="hash-link" href="#may-i-know-until-when-your-referral-is-valid-i-was-hoping-to-start-my-application-a-bit-later-so-was-hoping-to-reach-out-to-you-then-for-a-referral-is-there-any-last-date-to-claim-this-in-any-way" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>As long as I remain employed at Facebook, I&#x27;m happy to refer you if I feel that you stand a good chance passing the interviews. As mentioned earlier, if you apply when unprepared, you risk wasting the chance. Take too long and apply too late, then you risk the slots being all filled up. I don&#x27;t know the last date to be referred but I recommend not later than end of September.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="any-tips-for-a-good-resume-to-apply-for-fb"></a>Any tips for a good resume to apply for FB?<a class="hash-link" href="#any-tips-for-a-good-resume-to-apply-for-fb" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Answered above. I don&#x27;t think most students need to worry about the resume screening stage. Worry about the interviews. Use a neat and standard template and you should be fine.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="if-i-build-my-projects-must-some-of-them-be-pushed-to-production-before-applying"></a>If I build my projects must some of them be pushed to production before applying?<a class="hash-link" href="#if-i-build-my-projects-must-some-of-them-be-pushed-to-production-before-applying" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Best if you can, but I&#x27;m not sure if recruiters actually click on your project links. Maybe just don&#x27;t include the link if it&#x27;s not really usable?</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="do-you-have-any-tips-in-applying-for-a-fresh-grad-swe-role-in-facebook"></a>Do you have any tips in applying for a fresh grad SWE role in facebook?<a class="hash-link" href="#do-you-have-any-tips-in-applying-for-a-fresh-grad-swe-role-in-facebook" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Make sure you know your algorithms at the back of your hand. Fresh grad SWE role interviews also have a behavioral round, so be prepared to talk about your past experiences. There&#x27;s a section in this handbook which covers those.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="apart-from-preparing-for-dsa-questions-are-there-other-areas-you-would-recommend-preparing-for-either-for-the-interviews--a-better-chance-to-get-shortlisted-for-them"></a>Apart from preparing for DSA questions, are there other areas you would recommend preparing for (either for the interviews / a better chance to get shortlisted for them)?<a class="hash-link" href="#apart-from-preparing-for-dsa-questions-are-there-other-areas-you-would-recommend-preparing-for-either-for-the-interviews--a-better-chance-to-get-shortlisted-for-them" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>If you&#x27;re going for a SWE intern/grad position, DSA is the most important. The bulk of the assessment is on DSA. Grind your LeetCode.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="would-love-to-find-out-what-the-interviewers-at-facebook-usually-look-out-for-in-candidates"></a>Would love to find out what the interviewers at Facebook usually look out for in candidates!<a class="hash-link" href="#would-love-to-find-out-what-the-interviewers-at-facebook-usually-look-out-for-in-candidates" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>DSA. DSA. DSA. Communication skills - You must be able to also communicate your thought process well throughout the interview.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="am-i-able-to-apply-for-both-local-and-overseas-in-the-usa-roles-for-fb-and-be-considered-for-both-or-would-i-only-be-considered-for-sgs-openings-since-fb-has-an-office-here-and-im-already-located-in-sg"></a>Am I able to apply for both local and overseas (in the USA) roles for FB and be considered for both?

Typically you will only be interviewed for one location. Candidates based in Singapore are free to apply to non-Singapore positions and intern there.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="what-is-the-application-process-like-for-the-software-engineer-role-is-it-any-different-from-the-enterprise-and-front-end-engineer-role"></a>What is the application process like for the Software Engineer role?

I&#x27;m not sure about Enterprise Engineers, I suspect it wouldn&#x27;t be too different. For Front End Engineers, the questions will be domain-specific, hence will require candidates to write HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Note that Facebook Singapore currently does not hire Front End Engineers and interns. If you&#x27;re interested in a Front End Engineer internship/FTE position, you&#x27;d have to look overseas.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="is-there-anything-i-can-doprepare-to-improve-my-chances-of-getting-through-the-recruiter-screen"></a>Is there anything I can do/prepare to improve my chances of getting through the recruiter screen?<a class="hash-link" href="#is-there-anything-i-can-doprepare-to-improve-my-chances-of-getting-through-the-recruiter-screen" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ol><li>Get a referral</li><li>Have a solid neat resume that showcases your abilities</li></ol><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="how-much-does-a-referral-help-in-landing-a-interview"></a>How much does a referral help in landing a interview?<a class="hash-link" href="#how-much-does-a-referral-help-in-landing-a-interview" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Referrals tend to have a higher visibility than someone who applies on the Careers Portal directly, but that&#x27;s about it.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="are-there-any-related-full-time-openings-at-fb-and-if-so-how-can-i-help-you-decide-if-im-a-good-candidate-to-refer"></a>Are there any related full time openings at FB, and if so how can I help you decide if I&#x27;m a good candidate to refer?<a class="hash-link" href="#are-there-any-related-full-time-openings-at-fb-and-if-so-how-can-i-help-you-decide-if-im-a-good-candidate-to-refer" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>I look through your transcript and resume and look for stuff that suggests you&#x27;d make a good employee. What things I look out for - excellent grades in the relevant modules, notable internships, interesting side projects, ICPC/IOI awards. Bonus: Open Source experience. I&#x27;m a huge fan of Open Source and if you have built something really cool that&#x27;s Open Source, I&#x27;d refer you even if your grades are terrible.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="do-i-stand-a-good-chance-if-im-from-a-info-systems-background-but-gotten-good-grades-for-programming-modules-currently-taking-some-cs-modules-now-too"></a>Do I stand a good chance if I&#x27;m from a Info Systems background but gotten good grades for programming modules?

As long as you can demonstrate that you have mastery of programming and DSA, it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="would-you-know-whether-facebooks-hiring-process-has-a-preference-for-single-page-resumes"></a>Would you know whether Facebook&#x27;s hiring process has a preference for single-page resumes?<a class="hash-link" href="#would-you-know-whether-facebooks-hiring-process-has-a-preference-for-single-page-resumes" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>As an interviewer for FB senior-ish candidates, I have seen some horrendously long resumes. So I would think single-page is not a hard rule, more of a recommendation.

This was before I started working at Facebook, so the Facebook branding isn&#x27;t the main reason.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="im-an-international-student-at-smu-does-facebook-sponsor-employment-pass"></a>I&#x27;m an international student at SMU, does Facebook sponsor employment pass?<a class="hash-link" href="#im-an-international-student-at-smu-does-facebook-sponsor-employment-pass" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>IANAL.

General tip for coding interviews - focus on the most common data structures and algorithms. If a particular topic is really obscure, most likely you won&#x27;t be asked on it because asking obscure stuff sometimes work against the interviewers as it&#x27;d be harder for them to extract the right signals out of it.

The algorithm questions asked can be implemented in most programming languages (but you probably want to avoid using wenyan). If you&#x27;re applying for a specialized position, then you might be asked to use domain-specific languages, which the recruiter should (will?) let you know ahead of time.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="internship"></a>Internship<a class="hash-link" href="#internship" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="what-are-3-qualities-of-a-internnew-hire-fellow-fb-engineers-look-out-for"></a>What are 3 qualities of a intern/new hire fellow FB engineers look out for?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-3-qualities-of-a-internnew-hire-fellow-fb-engineers-look-out-for" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>This is a long answer and there are more than 3 qualities. But to get a conversion offer, in summary, interns have to show productivity and complete their assigned projects within the internship duration, product high quality code/work, demonstrate fast learning speed, actively communicate and collaborate, and show initiative and independence. Pretty much common sense if you ask me.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="what-are-the-different-types-of-internship-roles-that-are-opening-in-fb-both-here-in-sg-and-overseas"></a>What are the different types of internship roles that are opening in FB (both here in SG and overseas)!<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-the-different-types-of-internship-roles-that-are-opening-in-fb-both-here-in-sg-and-overseas" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>IANACP.

To answer seriously, it really depends on the team and their work. Most (all?) SWEs write code to solve problems. FB is big enough such that there are teams using almost every language out there.</p><p>Here&#x27;s an oversimplified overview:</p><ul><li>Web Products - JavaScript/React/CSS/GraphQL/Relay/Hack (typed version of PHP)</li><li>Mobile - Objective-C/Java/React Native/Proprietary frameworks</li><li>Back End Services - Java/C++/Python</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="what-is-the-internship-format-in-facebook-like-for-example-are-the-interns-inserted-into-a-team-to-work-on-issues-or-are-they-handed-a-project-to-work-on-throughout-their-internship"></a>What is the internship format in Facebook like?

They will be assigned an Intern Manager that would serve as their mentor throughout the internship. The mentor is typically the one who came up with the project which is broken down into multiple milestones. Responsibilities of an intern manager include: onboarding the intern, giving the intern regular feedback on how they are doing, reviewing their code (typically together with other members of the team), evaluating whether the intern will get a return offer.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="hows-the-mentorship-like-for-fb-interns-do-a-mentor-work-together-with-intern-on-the-same-project-are-mentors-randomly-assigned-within-the-company-or-do-they-volunteer-for-it"></a>How&#x27;s the mentorship like for FB interns?

Employees can sign up to be an intern manager for a specific internship season. It is not random. It would be a disastrous and unpleasant experience for both the intern and the intern manager if an employee got randomly assigned to be a manager.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="what-are-some-products-that-interns-will-get-to-work-on-in-facebook-singapore"></a>What are some products that interns will get to work on in Facebook Singapore?<a class="hash-link" href="#what-are-some-products-that-interns-will-get-to-work-on-in-facebook-singapore" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Intern projects are typically self-contained and achievable within the internship duration. Some example of intern projects in FB SG - rebuilding Oculus Accounts Portal (<a href="https://secure.oculus.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://secure.oculus.com</a>) using a modern React design system, building a self-serve order return flow into Oculus Accounts Portal. Outside of FB SG - Building the settings page of facebook.com, building an internal debugging tool (something like Redux Devtools).</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="what-kind-of-projects-are-interns-usually-given-like-internal-tooling-or-external-products"></a>What kind of projects are interns usually given (like internal tooling or external products)<a class="hash-link" href="#what-kind-of-projects-are-interns-usually-given-like-internal-tooling-or-external-products" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Answered above. Can be both, depends on the team. In Singapore, we primarily have product teams, so the projects are likely about adding product features.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="will-there-be-any-chances-of-being-transferred-to-an-overseas-office-after-being-accepted-as-an-intern"></a>Will there be any chances of being transferred to an overseas office after being accepted as an intern?<a class="hash-link" href="#will-there-be-any-chances-of-being-transferred-to-an-overseas-office-after-being-accepted-as-an-intern" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Yes I know of that happening to some ex-interns. However, that could be due to special COVID circumstances which might not necessarily apply in following years. You&#x27;d have to check with the recruiter.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="how-many-interns-is-fb-looking-to-onboard-next-summer-not-sure-if-this-can-revealed-but-thought-ill-ask-nonetheless"></a>How many interns is FB looking to onboard next summer?

For FTEs, much more autonomy.</p><p>Longer answer: Interns are assigned a project which usually have a pre-defined tech stack. So the engineering work and stack that an intern will be doing is highly dependent on the assigned team and project. If the intern finishes the work early, it&#x27;s possible to ask for more work from their manager and possibly try out other things. If the internship duration coincides with one of the internal hackathons, interns can participate in them and work on anything they want. For SWEs, there&#x27;s a process called bootcamp after joining where employees find their own team to join. That gives them more flexibility in deciding what kind of work they want to do. Internal mobility is very good within FB as well. Personally I&#x27;ve done both front end and back end at Facebook.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="fb-culture"></a>FB Culture<a class="hash-link" href="#fb-culture" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="whats-the-difference-between-software-engineer-swe-enterprise-engineer-ee-and-front-end-engineer-this-is-because-i-heard-from-previous-fb-interns-that-they-worked-on-the-full-stack"></a>What&#x27;s the difference between Software Engineer (SWE), Enterprise Engineer (EE), and Front End Engineer?

That doesn&#x27;t mean Front End Engineers can only work on front end stuff, they can work on anything as long as it is what their team needs and they have alignment with their manager.

Perhaps you meant SF Bay Area. Anyway, FB SG and FB US differ is quite a lot of ways. There are too many to list but I&#x27;ll list the most obvious ones.</p><ul><li>Career Progression - FB US, being the HQ and where the company started, has the most number of teams and you have all levels of seniority of folks there. In FB SG, there are fewer teams and due to the size of the office now, there isn&#x27;t a need for extremely senior engineers yet. So if you&#x27;re talking about long term career progression, SG definitely loses out here. But don&#x27;t need to think so far la, FB SG is still big enough for you to get to senior engineer position and earn enough to live comfortably for the rest of your life.</li><li>Projects - Primarily product teams and hires primarily SWEs and EEs, while FB US has a good mix of teams, including infrastructure teams and hires across all roles. So if you&#x27;re interested in working on infra stuff like our internal logging framework, GraphQL, our internal ORM, you&#x27;d have to look at non-SG offices.</li><li>Changing Teams - SG has fewer teams, so if you were looking to change teams but remain in Singapore, the choices are more limited.</li><li>Company Culture - You don&#x27;t get to attend the events held only at the HQ in-person, such as Zuck&#x27;s Q&amp;A or company town halls or the summer and holiday parties (but there are local versions of them).</li><li>Food - Smaller selection of cafes. Food is still pretty darn good though. There&#x27;s nothing to complain about free food.</li><li>Office - Smaller office in SG, but still one of the coolest in SG. Menlo Park Headquarters is amazing, there&#x27;s an arcade, board games room, a barber, ice cream shop, a gadgets vending machine, and more. It looks like Universal Studios at night. I&#x27;ll just leave this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cY3sMN3wohg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> here.</li><li>$$$ - FB pay is top tier in both US and SG. However in SG, you have to pay less tax and cheaper living expenses. In SG, I earn less but save more due to the large difference in taxes.</li><li>Taxes - SG tax is crazy low compared to US. US taxes you on every damn thing, including the capital gains from your stocks and bank interest earned (WTF), but SG doesn&#x27;t.</li><li>Engineering Culture - Similar-ish because quite a number of engineers in FB SG moved here from FB US, including myself. But being a smaller office, we don&#x27;t have extremely senior engineers (no principal and higher).</li><li>Social Security - I thought Bay Area was relatively safer than the smaller US states, but these days <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ybiHCxNb3w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">driving on the highway also can get shot</a>, so I don&#x27;t know anymore. I think SG is definitely safer, at least you definitely won&#x27;t kena any racist remarks or comments while walking on the streets.</li><li>Personal Happiness - Obviously you&#x27;d have fewer friends and family if you&#x27;re in the US. If that&#x27;s important to you then life there might be hard. But you can make new angmoh friends or hang out with the steadily growing SG community over there.</li><li>Dating Scene - If you&#x27;re single, it might be hard to find a long-term partner there. The female Singaporean engineers there are mostly taken, those that are not, probably want to stay single. Dating there will be quite hard! I know of friends who got together with Americans/immigrants and then they get a green card and plan to stay there for good. You can consider that too.</li></ul><p>I would describe myself as a small fish in a big pond when I was in FB US and am now a big fish in a smaller pond in FB SG.

If we were to hire only people who have prior experience with them, then we&#x27;d have a really hard time filling our head count.</p><p>When tech companies hire SWEs, usually it&#x27;s for a generalist position and they would expect the employees to pick up any new language or tool to get the job down. If you master your fundamentals, doing that shouldn&#x27;t be too hard. So really most companies would want to hire people who can learn fast and adapt. The exception is if you&#x27;re a super senior person (think principal level and above), then you&#x27;d be hired for your specialized skillsets probably because the company needs some subject-matter expert in that area. But most of you are still undergrads, that doesn&#x27;t apply to you.</p><p>At the end of the day, many language and tools are similar-ish. New technologies learn from existing technologies and improve on them, learning new technologies isn&#x27;t always that foreign.</p><p>However, to be a good SWE, I would recommend peeking beneath the abstraction layers and understanding what problem this technology is trying to solve, how it works under the hood, and what advantages/disadvantages it has compared to similar technologies. That&#x27;s why I love Open Source, all the code is public - you can read the code, look at how the projects are structured, and even contribute to them. I also love reading articles comparing technologies so that I know what tradeoffs the projects are making and what&#x27;s the right tool for the job. Don&#x27;t be a mindless drone who uses technologies without knowing why you are using it instead of alternatives. That&#x27;ll be an easy way to get phased out really soon, especially considering how fast technologies move.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="in-my-conversations-with-most-engineers-from-us-tech-companies-i-often-hear-that-one-of-the-major-shortcomings-of-working-in-the-singapore-offices-is-that-they-are-more-auxiliary-in-their-functions-and-that-opportunities-for-core-engineering-work-are-few-and-far-between-since-you-have-worked-in-both-the-menlo-park-and-sg-offices-id-love-to-hear-your-response-to-this-within-the-context-of-facebook"></a>In my conversations with most engineers from US tech companies, I often hear that one of the major shortcomings of working in the Singapore offices is that they are more auxiliary in their functions, and that opportunities for &quot;core&quot; engineering work are few and far between.

That&#x27;s why I chose to do client side engineering. As to why the web, I like the fast iteration and release cycle of building on web platforms. My first hardcore CS course was actually CS3217 (I only took CS1010E and CS1020E prior to that), so the first proper software I wrote was on iOS platform. Developing on mobile is too troublesome for my liking, because I often need a physical device, compiling the app takes so long, and you have to play by the platform&#x27;s rules. They could take down your app anytime they want. On the other hand, the web is much more open and anyone can launch any website they want in a matter of hours. Being able to show people what I built by giving them a URL is an exciting experience that never gets old.</p><p>I haven&#x27;t worked at Google so I can&#x27;t comment on workload at Google. But Google is known as a good company to &quot;rest and vest&quot; whereas Facebook has faster promo cycles and rewards their top performing employees disproportionately.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="am-i-correct-to-interpret-that-you-started-at-grab-after-graduation-what-internships-did-you-do-during-your-studies"></a>Am I correct to interpret that you started at Grab after graduation?

Being at Facebook is fun because I get to do front end work which isn&#x27;t product, such as building React-based design systems, front end tooling, lint rules, CSS frameworks (Infima), Static site generators (Docusaurus).</p><p>Facebook is the leader in terms of front end web technologies. If you develop on the web, you would more likely than not, be using some of Facebook&#x27;s open source work, whether directly or not. There&#x27;s React, Flux, Jest, GraphQL, React Native, Docusaurus, Draft.js, Relay, Flow, just to name a few. By working at Facebook, I also got the chance to work on Docusaurus and for two years, led the development of Docusaurus v2, which is one of the projects I am most proud of in my career. Today, Docusaurus is powering most of Facebook&#x27;s open source websites. Many of the open source leaders I look up to were also at Facebook. I got to contribute to many high profile open source front end projects by Facebook and also work alongside the creator of React (Jordan Walke) on improving the front end of Facebook&#x27;s Ads Interfaces. Not to mention that Facebook employees will be the first to dogfood React&#x27;s new APIs and participate in design discussions and influence the future roadmap of React.</p><p>On the culture and working environment front, I have always vibed with Facebook&#x27;s hacker culture and products more than Google&#x27;s, so naturally I chose Facebook over Google even though their offers were comparable and I was given a chance to work on Google&#x27;s search results page.</p><p>Facebook is the best place for a Front End Engineer to grow and learn from the very best. So it was the most obvious choice for me and I&#x27;m glad I made that decision. It&#x27;s the best place I&#x27;ve worked at thus far (almost 4 years!) and also financially a great choice.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="could-i-ask-about-your-personal-experiences-at-fb-in-terms-of-learning-opportunities-and-the-work-you-do-"></a>Could I ask about your personal experiences at FB in terms of learning opportunities and the work you do? :)<a class="hash-link" href="#could-i-ask-about-your-personal-experiences-at-fb-in-terms-of-learning-opportunities-and-the-work-you-do-" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The learning opportunities depend on many factors - individual preferences, team, projects, luck. Facebook is such a large company that covers virtually almost every domain of technology one can be interested in. With great internal mobility, it isn&#x27;t hard to find a project that one will be passionate about. The benefits (and also downsides) of working at such a large company is that you often have to think about scalability in your work. How do you scale your work to the tens of thousands of engineers using your libraries or the billions of users using your product?</p><p>Facebook is also a company which takes the growth of employees very seriously. We have clear levels and expectations for engineers, supportive managers who really care about the growth of their team, mentorship programs available for anyone who wants to grow in a particular area. One of a manager&#x27;s core responsibilities is to grow their team and employees, and they are being evaluated on that, so you can be sure that they treat it seriously. We have weekly 1:1s with managers and with our leads. Personally I&#x27;m mentoring around 3-4 junior engineers and helping them to grow into senior engineers in both their technical and organizational skills.</p><p>I&#x27;ve answered about my work above.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="what-made-you-and-the-team-came-up-with-the-idea-of-nusmods-and-nuswhispers-i-think-its-really-great-to-code-for-good-and-fulfilling-stuff-rather-than-coding-for-corporate-means"></a>What made you and the team came up with the idea of NUSMods and NUSWhispers?

Joining NUSMods was one of the best decisions in my life, as impacted the lives of so many students (I daresay above 100k), learnt so much from working on it (it&#x27;s a relatively complex web application), and it helped me grow my network of like-minded individuals. <strong>We need more people to contribute so that the project can live on.</strong> Notice that the NUSMods core team (and alumni) have pretty zai backgrounds? Correlation or causation? Maybe both.</p><p>I came up with the idea for NUSWhispers but I didn&#x27;t write much code for it. I was tutor for a web development course (CP3101B) back in 2015 and I proposed that idea to some students. I&#x27;m glad they did a darn good job of it. Back then I wanted to create a platform that could connect and help students around the school and the idea of an anonymous platform/page sounded like fun.</p><p>I like building stuff that people use, and after graduation I try to open source my stuff.

Maybe not as much as quant trading firms, but if you also factor in other stuff like interesting work, social impact, then to me FB still comes up on top.</li><li>Bottom-up culture. In some companies, engineers are treated like mindless drones and expected to just execute. But not at FB. At FB, engineers are expected to do a fair bit of product and project management, propose ideas and lead the roadmap for their team, especially if their team&#x27;s product is a highly technical one. We have lots of flexibility and autonomy to manage our own work and what we want to do with our time.

We set goals for the half and then we&#x27;re pretty much running the project each on our own. On a day-to-day basis, I spent about half my time writing code and the other half reviewing code and attending meetings.

Back in school, I never really had an official CCA - I chose to do tutoring, work on open source stuff like NUSMods, and working as a boarding councillor at NUS High (sort of like RA but for NUS High Students), which gave me free accommodation near school).

As engineers, sometimes we get too focused on execution and it&#x27;s easy to forget about communicating our work broadly. Perhaps some of us are new to Facebook and previously did not have the tools to foster communication nor was it emphasized by the company.</p><p>I love to code. Personally, I would love to shut off all communication channels and focus entirely on coding if I could. However, doing that will probably have disastrous effects. Communication is super important and I learnt that the hard way when I first started at Facebook. In my first year at Facebook, I made a few painful mistakes related to communication. I changed the project plans and timeline without informing my tech lead, resulting in my teammate having to cover me at the last minute and do the work I reprioritized without telling anyone. In another instance, I didn&#x27;t communicate that I was going to do some work that my teammate had planned to do, resulting in wasted efforts. From then on, I made a mental note to myself to communicate broadly and early wherever possible and seek alignment. I&#x27;d err on the side of over-communicating rather than under-communicating (though sometimes I still forget).</p><div class="text--center"><figure><img alt="You cannot have bad communication if you never communicate" src="/assets/images/bad-communication-f27562ebe06bd05ccc778cd741145ba1.jpg"><figcaption>Just like you can&#x27;t cause any bugs if you don&#x27;t write any code.</figcaption></figure></div><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="why-is-communication-important"></a>Why is communication important?<a class="hash-link" href="#why-is-communication-important" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Nobody at Facebook works alone. When you work with people, you have to communicate with them â€” to set expectations, seek feedback, align on decisions, what not. However, given that remote working is the norm for most of us now, we rarely see each other face to face (I haven&#x27;t met anyone on the team in person since remote work started). In product teams like the ones we have in Commerce Engineering Singapore, we work with a myriad of XFN partners across the globe in different timezones. These factors make it challenging to be in regular touch and makes it even more important to communicate widely. We have to explicitly communicate through stand ups, weekly syncs, retros, Work Chat messages, Workplace posts, etc.</p><p>Communicating well frequently and broadly helps you to:</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="broaden-your-impact"></a>Broaden your impact<a class="hash-link" href="#broaden-your-impact" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>If you have built something that&#x27;s useful for yourself/your team, chances are, they will be useful for others as well, so tell more people about it! My first project at Facebook was to build Sentinel, an internal code attribution tool for the Ads code base. The tool solved the problem of people/bots changing a set of files which they were unfamiliar with and not knowing who the best reviewers for those changes were. Nothing about the tool was specific to Ads. After building an MVP version of the tool, we reached out to various tools within Facebook which use their own bespoke code attribution approach and we eventually helped to replace them with Sentinel attribution. We also integrated it with popular tools like our IDE (a FB-specific VS Code), our internal component library, and our internal in-browser code explorer. At the end of that half (2018 H1), Sentinel was used by 2% of all diffs at Facebook, which was a pretty significant number. As of writing, over 580k diffs at Facebook have used Sentinel and I would say a huge part of its success was due to the network effects generated by word-of-mouth advertising by our early adopters, our push to integrate it into popular tools, and links within these tools that Sentinel was powering the attribution.</p><p>Takeaway â€” Make a noise! <strong>A good product that many people use has more impact than an excellent product that few people use.</strong> Sentinel wasn&#x27;t perfect at the time of launch but it worked well enough. One of the easiest ways to get people to use your product is to tell people about it! It can&#x27;t get any easier. Getting some people to use your product early also gives you the chance to iterate on feedback and make it better before you launch it to a wider audience.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="improve-your-career-performance-and-progression"></a>Improve your career performance and progression<a class="hash-link" href="#improve-your-career-performance-and-progression" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Communication has a huge impact on one&#x27;s performance. If you aren&#x27;t able to effectively update your manager on what you are doing, it is hard for them to help you stay on track to ensure you meet expectations for the half. Communication is explicitly written as part of how an engineer is evaluated - through driving alignment and project management, but really, it is necessary for every axis. We saw how effective communication helps expand one&#x27;s project impact in the Sentinel example above. Better engineering practices should be communicated to folks who work on the same code base so as to efficiently deliver products of excellent implementation quality. Strong communication also leads to successful conflict resolution, mentorship and recruiting.</p><p>Here&#x27;s a scenario on how communication impacts calibrations - Alice&#x27;s manager put her up for promotion to IC6 after successfully delivering on an impactful project. However, due to lack of communication and visibility about her project, it&#x27;s the first time other managers in the room heard about this project and many raised questions regarding it due to their unfamiliarity with it. This made the calibration process much harder than it should have been had Alice communicated about her project broadly earlier on.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="influence"></a>Influence<a class="hash-link" href="#influence" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Influence is a core skill you need to develop as you grow your career, and communication is at the core of it. Senior folks are leaders and influential and are effective communicators. This is true regardless of IC track or management track. IC5+s are expected to be able to influence the engineering culture in the broader team and possess strong communication skills to be able to explain technical information effectively. Recently I attended a meeting with a very senior Software Engineer and was blown away by how he managed to explain the concept of cookies in such simple terms to the non-technical folks in the meeting and how effective communication helps you to get things done. For those who are interested in embarking on the manager track in future, please also know that most of an engineering manager&#x27;s job involves communication.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="foster-alignment-and-save-effort-down-the-road"></a>Foster alignment and save effort down the road<a class="hash-link" href="#foster-alignment-and-save-effort-down-the-road" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Facebook is a huge company and at such a scale, it&#x27;s not uncommon for two teams at Facebook to face the same problem. I&#x27;ll use Sentinel as an example again. By communicating about the project broadly and early, we reduced the possibility of teams working in silos to solve the same problem and leading to duplicated efforts. By knowing which teams faced similar problems and understanding their unique circumstances, we were able to collaborate on the problem and accounted for the different needs of the various teams, achieving a 1 + 1 = 3 effect.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="facilitate-project-planning-and-ensure-timelines-are-met"></a>Facilitate project planning and ensure timelines are met<a class="hash-link" href="#facilitate-project-planning-and-ensure-timelines-are-met" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Imagine this extreme (but still plausible) scenario - Bob and his team have spent a few months working on a huge project which was slated to launch next week. However, the project is only half-completed due to unforeseen technical difficulties and lack of manpower. If Bob had communicated about the difficulties and progress earlier, his manager could have allocated more manpower earlier to help out, and the team would probably be in a better position to meet their deadlines. This scenario is unrealistic at Facebook in the sense that such issues would probably be caught earlier because of weekly syncs and progress update posts. However, it is still possible for smaller projects where there aren&#x27;t any/many syncs.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="ways-to-communicate-effectively"></a>Ways to communicate effectively<a class="hash-link" href="#ways-to-communicate-effectively" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Hopefully by now you agree with me that communicating effectively broadly and frequently is important! Here are some tips on how to go about doing that:</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="leverage-communication-channels"></a>Leverage Communication Channels<a class="hash-link" href="#leverage-communication-channels" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Each company has its own communication channel - Slack, Discord, Google Suite, etc. At Facebook, we use <a href="https://workplace.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workplace</a>, which is similar to the core Facebook app, but for your company. Workplace is literally a communication tool and it is also the easiest way to get the word out about something. Draft a Workplace post/note and post it in the right groups. Attach screenshots/videos to better illustrate the point and catch peoples&#x27; attention. Add tl;drs at the top of your posts. Structure your posts according to sections for better organization. If you are unsure about what content should go in your post, seek a review from your manager/tech lead, most likely they&#x27;ll be happy to help.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="write-wikis"></a>Write Wikis<a class="hash-link" href="#write-wikis" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Write wikis for posterity and so that your work appears in intern search results. Add links to your new wiki in existing relevant wikis. Doing all these improves the discoverability of your work.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2LWZ" id="shamelessly-reach-out-to-folks"></a>Shamelessly reach out to folks<a class="hash-link" href="#shamelessly-reach-out-to-folks" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>If you know of someone/another team that would benefit from your work or the information, reach out to them and let them know! Even if they don&#x27;t have an immediate need for your work, they might in future, or can inform others about it. The relationships you build along the way might surprise you.</p><hr><p>Thanks to my manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishita-agarwal-51872514/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nishita Agarwal</a> and my teammate, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leow-yao-yang/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yao Yang Leow</a> for proofreading and giving feedback on earlier drafts.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/career">career</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/communication">communication</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Importance of Communicating Effectively as Engineers" href="/blog/importance-of-communicating-effectively-as-engineers"><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="blogPostTitle_GeHD"><a href="/blog/are-front-end-development-skills-enough-for-a-career">Are Front End Development Skills Enough for a Career?</a></h2><div class="blogPostData_291c margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2019-11-03T00:00:00.000Z">November 3, 2019</time> Â· 8 min read</div><div class="avatar margin-vert--md"><a href="https://github.com/yangshun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link avatar__photo"><img src="https://github.com/yangshun.png" alt="Yangshun Tay"></a><div class="avatar__intro"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/yangshun" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yangshun Tay</a></div><small class="avatar__subtitle"></small></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Recently, an undergrad freshmen I met at an event asked me a question regarding Front End development as a career.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/front-end">front end</a><a class="margin-horiz--sm" href="/blog/tags/career">career</a></div><div class="col text--right"><a aria-label="Read more about Are Front End Development Skills Enough for a Career?" href="/blog/are-front-end-development-skills-enough-for-a-career"><b>Read More</b></a></div></footer></article></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2021 Yangshun Tay.
